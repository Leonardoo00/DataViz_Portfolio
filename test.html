    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This portfolio is built as part of the Data Visualization exam. The graphs displayed follow the guidelines provided by the Professor.</p>

    <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        Refer to the references section for complete data sources and citations. Python has been selected as the primary programming language due to its simplicity and extensive support for external libraries.
        In particular, <a href="https://plotly.com/python/" target="_blank">Plotly</a> was chosen for its robust and comprehensive capabilities in data visualization, enabling the creation of interactive and informative charts.

    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Figure 1</em> is an area chart showing the distribution of global energy sources from 1960 to 2014, stacked year by year. The legend and title are correctly presented, providing context to the reader. 
        However, the y-axis lacks any reference to the unit measurement used. Are the values shown in percentage or absolute production? This omission reduces the effectiveness and readability of the chart. 
        The color choice also reduces clarity due to overlapping areas.  
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Use a more distinct color palette.</li>
        <li>Specify the unit of measurement in the title.</li>
        <li>Add labels to the y-axis.</li>
        <li>Include gridlines to improve readability.</li>
    </ol>

    </figure>

    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Figure 2</em> represents a personal revision of the figure shown in the previous section. Improvements include a more distinct color palette, clearer y-axis labels, and the inclusion of gridlines.
        Additionally, the unit of measurement has been specified in the title. Notably, the data source differs from that used in <em>Figure 1</em>, providing a broader and potentially more accurate representation of global energy production.
