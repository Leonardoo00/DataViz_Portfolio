    <h1>Data Visualization Portofolio</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Leonardo Mario di Gennaro</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This portfolio is built as part of the Data Visualization exam. The graphs displayed follow the guidelines provided by the Professor.</p>

    <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        Python has been selected as the primary programming language due to its simplicity and extensive support for external libraries.  
        In particular, <a href="https://plotly.com/python/" target="_blank">Plotly</a> was chosen for its robust and comprehensive capabilities in data visualization.
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Figure 1</em> is an area chart showing the distribution of global energy sources from 1960 to 2014, stacked year by year. The legend and title are correctly presented, providing context to the reader.  
        However, the y-axis lacks any reference to the unit measurement used. Are the values shown in percentage or absolute production? This omission reduces the effectiveness and readability of the chart.  
        The color choice also reduces clarity due to overlapping areas.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Use a more distinct color palette.</li>
        <li>Specify the unit of measurement in the title.</li>
        <li>Add labels to the y-axis.</li>
        <li>Include gridlines to improve readability.</li>
        World Count 139.
    </ol>

    </figure>

    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Figure 2</em> represents a personal revision of the figure shown in the previous section. Improvements include a more distinct color palette, clearer y-axis labels, and the inclusion of gridlines.  
        Additionally, the unit of measurement has been specified in the title. Notably, the data source differs from that used in <em>Figure 1</em>, providing a broader and potentially more accurate representation of global energy production.

    <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
    <p>
        This visualization from Our World in Data effectively illustrates the relationship between CO₂ emissions per capita and GDP per capita across various countries in 2022. The positive correlation between economic wealth and consumption-based CO₂ emissions is clearly presented, supporting the economic rationale that higher wealth often leads to greater energy consumption and, consequently, higher emissions.
        A notable strength of this chart is the use of bubble sizes to represent population, offering a multi-dimensional perspective. This allows viewers to not only assess how wealthy a country is and how much CO₂ it emits but also how its population size influences its overall environmental impact. Additionally, the effective color-coding by continent helps differentiate regional trends, making it easier to compare countries with their peers.
        To further enhance this insightful visualization, highlighting outliers could provide deeper insights into countries that significantly diverge from the general trend, revealing unique economic or environmental strategies.

    <h2>Exercise 4/5</h2>
    <p>
        In light of the recent LA wildfires, I felt compelled to dive into climate change data. After spending hours sifting through massive datasets and creating countless drafts of complex graphs, I realized that simplicity often speaks the loudest.
        I decided to focus on one critical metric: global surface temperature change. This measure is widely recognized in academic research as a powerful indicator that encapsulates the core concerns of climate change.
        The graph below tells a clear story. No complex models, no noise—just the raw truth.
        Draw your own conclusions. Sometimes, the simplest view is the most impactful.

    <h2>Exercise 6</h2>
    <p>
        The simplest visualizations are often the most impactful due to their clarity and ease of understanding. The balance between simplicity and information is crucial. However, introducing a certain level of complexity is necessary to explore and interpret more intricate phenomena.
        The following map chart utilizes the same dataset from Exercise 4/5, providing a dynamic view of global temperature changes over time. The use of a darker color scale for regions with higher temperature increases enhances the visualization’s ability to highlight critical climate trends.
